# bikesharing_demand-forecasting
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to forecast the demand for bike rentals using historical usage patterns and weather data. By predicting demand, bike-sharing companies can optimize operations, manage inventory, and improve user satisfaction.

🎯 Objectives
Preprocess and clean the dataset for accurate modeling.

Explore seasonal and weather-related patterns in bike demand.

Build a predictive model to estimate future bike rental counts.

Evaluate the model using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) for accuracy.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
Source: Bike sharing dataset (Kaggle/UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Features Include:

Date/time

Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed)

Seasonal indicators

Count of bikes rented

🔑 Key Steps
Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical features

Standardized numerical data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized demand patterns across seasons and weather conditions

Identified correlations between environmental factors and rental counts

Model Building and Evaluation

Built regression models for demand prediction

Evaluated performance using RMSLE metric to ensure accurate forecasting

📊 Insights
Demand is higher during summer and spring compared to winter.

Weather factors like temperature and humidity strongly influence rental counts.

Clear weather days record higher bike rental activity compared to rainy or snowy days.
